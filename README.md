# DFX API

DFX is a crypto on- and off-ramp with an open API that can be integrated by anyone. This page explains the basic concepts of the API. If you don't want to bother with API calls, you can integrate our ready-to-use web widget with a few lines of code (see the [services repository](https://github.com/DFXswiss/services#dfx-services)) or use our [React API npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfx.swiss/react).

### Swagger

- [Swagger UI](https://api.dfx.swiss)
- [Swagger JSON](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger-json)

### Authentication

Each user who wants to use the service must be registered separately with their blockchain address and a signature to prove ownership.

#### Initial Wallet Setup (optional)

Contact [support](mailto:support@dfx.swiss) to register your wallet name. This is used to identify all users that signed up with your wallet. This step is optional.

#### Sign-Up / Sign-In

1. Get the sign message from [sign-message endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/Auth/AuthController_getSignMessage) (with the user's address) and sign it with the corresponding private key
1. Sign the user up or in with the [auth endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/Auth/AuthController_authenticate). This call will register a new user, if the user does not exist yet. If there is already a user with the same address, the user will be signed in. The response contains a JWT access token, which can be used for further API calls. `usedRef`, `wallet` and `specialCode` parameters are optional. `usedRef` and `wallet` are only taken into account on user registration.
   - Use the wallet name (`wallet`) from step [initial setup](#initial-wallet-setup-optional)
   - See [below](#referral-program) for more information on the referral program (`usedRef`)

Alternatively the [sign-up](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/Auth/AuthController_signUp) and [sign-in](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/Auth/AuthController_signIn) endpoints can be used if only one functionality (sign-up or sign-in) is required.

#### Notifications

If a user wants to get notified about ongoing transactions, he can register his email address with the [user endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/User/UserController_updateUser)

#### Referral Program

- Basic information about the referral program can be found in our [FAQ](https://docs.dfx.swiss/en/faq)
- A referral code can only be set once during [user registration](#authentication) (`usedRef` parameter)
- Every user will receive his own referral code after the first successful transaction. It can be got from the [user endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/User/UserV2Controller_getUser).
- Details about the referred users can be got from the [ref endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/User/UserV2Controller_getRef).

### KYC (optional)

KYC is not required for a daily transaction volume up to 1000 CHF. To increase the transaction volume, the user needs to be verified with a KYC process, which can be done on the DFX KYC page. Just open then link to the KYC page with the user's API access token: `https://services.dfx.swiss/kyc?session=<jwt-access-token>`

The current KYC level of a user can be read using the [user endpoint](https://api.dfx.swiss/swagger/#/User/UserV2Controller_getUser). The different levels are listed below.

- Level 10: Contact data recorded (mail)
- Level 20: Personal data recorded (account type, name, address, phone number)
- Level 30: Successful identification with ID or passport
- Level 40: Financial background queried (income, assets, business activity)
- Level 50: Risk analysis carried out (start of the business relationship between DFX and the user)
